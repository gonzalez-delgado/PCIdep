\title{Test for the difference of two cluster means after hierarchical clustering, for matrix normal model with arbitrary scale matrices.
Supported linkages as in Gao et al. 2022 {"single", "average", "centroid", "ward.D", "median", "mcquitty", "complete"}.}
\usage{
test.clusters.hc(
  X,
  U = NULL,
  Sigma = NULL,
  Y = NULL,
  UY = NULL,
  precUY = NULL,
  NC,
  clusters,
  linkage = "average",
  plot = FALSE,
  ndraws = 2000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{n x p matrix drawn from a n x p matrix normal distribution MN(M,U,Sigma). X must have n rows and p columns.}

\item{U}{A n x n positive-definite matrix describing the dependence structure between the rows in X. If NULL, observations are considered independent and U is set to the n x x identity matrix.}

\item{Sigma}{A p x p positive-definite matrix describing the dependence structure between the columns in X. If NULL, Sigma is over-estimated (in the sens of the Loewner partial order).}

\item{Y}{If Sigma is NULL, an i.i.d. copy of X allowing its estimation. Y must have the same number of columns as X.}

\item{UY}{If Sigma is NULL, a positive-definite matrix describing the dependence structure between the rows in Y. If NULL and its inverse is not provided, set to the identity matrix by default.}

\item{precUY}{The inverse matrix of UY, that can be provided to increase computational efficiency. If UY is not NULL and precUY is NULL, precUY is obtained by inversing UY.}

\item{NC}{The number of clusters to choose.}

\item{clusters}{A vector of two integers from 1 to NC indicating the pair of clusters whose means have to be compared.}

\item{linkage}{The type of linkage for hierarchical clustering. Must be one in {"single", "average", "centroid", "ward.D", "median", "mcquitty", "complete"}.}

\item{plot}{Whether to plot the dendogram retrieved by the hierarchical clustering algorithm}

\item{ndraws}{If linkage is "complete", the number of Monte Carlo iterations.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
  \item pvalue - The p-value for the difference between cluster means.
  \item stat - The test statistic.
  \item stdrr - If linkage is "complete", the Monte Carlo standard error.
  \item hcl - The partition of the n observations retrieved by the clustering algorithm.

\examples{

n <- 50
p <- 20
M <- Matrix::Matrix(0, nrow = n , ncol = p) # Mean matrix
Sigma <- stats::toeplitz(seq(1, 0.1, length = p)) # Sigma: dependence between features
U <- matrixNormal::I(n) # U: dependence between observations
X <- matrixNormal::rmatnorm(s = 1, M, U, Sigma)
Y <- matrixNormal::rmatnorm(s = 1, M, U, Sigma) # i.i.d. copy of X

# HC with average linkage under the global null hypothesis
test.clusters.hc(X, U, Sigma, NC = 3, clusters = sample(1:3, 2), plot = TRUE, linkage = "average")
# HC with complete linkage under the global null hypothesis and over-estimation of Sigma
test.clusters.hc(X, U, Sigma = NULL, Y = Y, NC = 3, 
clusters = sample(1:3, 2), plot = TRUE, linkage = "complete")
