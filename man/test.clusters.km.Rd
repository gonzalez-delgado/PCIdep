\title{Test for the difference of two cluster means after k-means clustering, for matrix normal model with arbitrary scale matrices.}
\usage{
test.clusters.km(
  X,
  U = NULL,
  Sigma = NULL,
  Y = NULL,
  UY = NULL,
  precUY = NULL,
  NC,
  clusters,
  itermax = 10,
  tol = 1e-04
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{n x p matrix drawn from a n x p matrix normal distribution MN(M,U,Sigma). X must have n rows and p columns.}

\item{U}{A n x n positive-definite matrix describing the dependence structure between the rows in X. If NULL, observations are considered independent and U is set to the n x x identity matrix.}

\item{Sigma}{A p x p positive-definite matrix describing the dependence structure between the columns in X. If NULL, Sigma is over-estimated (in the sens of the Loewner partial order).}

\item{Y}{If Sigma is NULL, an i.i.d. copy of X allowing its estimation. Y must have the same number of columns as X.}

\item{UY}{If Sigma is NULL, a positive-definite matrix describing the dependence structure between the rows in Y. If NULL and its inverse is not provided, set to the identity matrix by default.}

\item{precUY}{The inverse matrix of UY, that can be provided to incredevlase computational efficiency. If UY is not NULL and precUY is NULL, precUY is obtained by inversing UY.}

\item{NC}{The number of clusters to choose.}

\item{clusters}{A vector of two integers from 1 to NC indicating the pair of clusters whose means have to be compared.}

\item{itermax}{The iter.max parameter of the k-means algorithm in kmeans_estimation function of KmeansInference package.}

\item{tol}{The tol_eps parameter of the k-means algorithm in kmeans_estimation function of KmeansInference package.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
  \item pvalue - The p-value for the difference between cluster means.
  \item stat - The test statistic.
  \item km - The partition of the n observations retrieved by the clustering algorithm.

\examples{

n <- 50
p <- 20
M <- Matrix::Matrix(0, nrow = n , ncol = p) # Mean matrix
Sigma <- stats::toeplitz(seq(1, 0.1, length = p)) # Sigma: dependence between features
U <- matrixNormal::I(n) # U: dependence between observations
X <- matrixNormal::rmatnorm(s = 1, M, U, Sigma)
Y <- matrixNormal::rmatnorm(s = 1, M, U, Sigma) # i.i.d. copy of X

# k-means under the global null hypothesis
test.clusters.km(X, U, Sigma, NC = 3, clusters = sample(1:3, 2))
# k-means under the global null hypothesis and over-estimation of Sigma
test.clusters.km(X, U, Sigma = NULL, Y = Y, NC = 3, clusters = sample(1:3, 2))
